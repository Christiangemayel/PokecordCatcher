# PokecordCatcher
Selfbot to catch pokemon when they spawn for the Pokecord discord bot

Example config:
```
{
  "token": "<your token>",
  "priority": ["Groudon", "Geodude"],
  "catch_rate": 90,
  "delay": 2
}
```

Keep catch rate low delay high for it to act normally.  
Priority pokemon bypass catch rate.  
Catch Rate is a percentage out of 100.  
Delay is in seconds.  
To find out how to get your token visit [Token Tutorial](https://github.com/TheRacingLion/Discord-SelfBot/wiki/Discord-Token-Tutorial).  
Preferably run this on an alt and trade, selfbots violate discord TOS and you can get banned.
